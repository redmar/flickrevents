== Getting Started

  You need to first get an API key as detailed here:

  http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html
  
== Installation

  sudo gem install flickr-fu

== Documentation

  RDoc Documentation can be found here:

  http://www.commonthread.com/projects/flickr_fu/rdoc/

== Authorization

  To authorise your application to access Flickr using your API key you will
  need to access a specific URL.
  
  To generate this URL run the following and when presented with the URL 
  access it from your browser. Confirm the application has permission at 
  the level you have specified.
  
  Finally, cache the token (this will create the token cache file)
  
  If you have an invalid API key you will see errors such as:
  
  "100: Invalid API Key"
  
  If you don't follow the process below to authorise your application
  you will see errors such as:
  
  "98: Login failed / Invalid auth token" or 
  "99: User not logged in / Insufficient permissions"
  
== Authorization Example

  require 'flickr_fu'
  
  flickr = Flickr.new('flickr.yml')
  
  puts "visit the following url, then click <enter> once you have authorized:"

  # request write permissions
  puts flickr.auth.url(:write)
  
  gets
  
  flickr.auth.cache_token

== Search Example

  require 'flickr_fu'

  flickr = Flickr.new('flickr.yml')

  photos = flickr.photos.search(:tags => 'ruby-flickr')

  puts "found #{photos.size} photo(s)"

  photos.each do |photo|
    puts photo.title
    puts photo.description unless [nil, ''].include?(photo.description)
    [:square, :thumbnail, :small, :medium, :large, :original].each do |size|
      puts "#{size}: #{photo.url(size)}"
    end
    puts "comments: #{photo.comments.size}"
    photo.comments.each do |comment|
      intro = "#{comment.author_name} says - "
      puts "#{intro}\"#{comment.comment.gsub("\n", "\n"+(" "*intro.length))}\""
    end
    puts "notes: #{photo.notes.size}"
    photo.notes.each do |note|
      puts "[#{note.x},#{note.y} ~ #{note.width}x#{note.height}] - \"#{note.note}\""
    end
    puts
    puts
  end
  
== Another Search Example

  If searching for photos by user id then you need to specify the 'alias' - without
  intervention this is usually set by Flickr and is an alphanumeric string. 
  
  To find out the user id for a given user, you can use the tool at:
  
  http://idgettr.com/
  
  And replace the line in the above sample to query on user id:
  
  photos = flickr.photos.search(:user_id => 'your_user_id_here')
